# BestBefore

This is my Objective-C solution to the following puzzle: 
You have some food you want to eat, but the best before date is confusing, you have 3 numbers, but you don't know which is the day, month, or year. You need to find the earliest date that the numbers could possibly make up so that you know if it's safe to eat. Because sometimes the year isn't given in a full format, if a number is less than 100 you can add 2000 to it to make it a year.

ex. 5, 7, 1 => May 7, 2001
